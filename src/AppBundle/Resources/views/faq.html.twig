      messaging apps to detect any signs of malicious messages and harassment
      in a conversation.</p>

    <h3>How does this work?</h3>

       comparing them with as large library of curse words raising a flag any
       time it finds a match.</p>

    <h3>Are my personal messages being saved</h3>
    <p>For the Bully Shield algorithm to function your messages are temperarily
       stored in our database which can only be accessed by us and our algorithm.
        If no harmful message is found then the message is discarded.</p>

    <h3>Can this program distinguish a joke from actual bullying?</h3>
    <p>The way our algorithm works on a two step verification that first locates
       the malicious word and then passes the sentence containing the word to a
       regular expression checker which distinguishes the jokes from the harmful
       messages.</p>
